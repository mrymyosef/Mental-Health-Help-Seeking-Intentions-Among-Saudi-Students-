•	Purpose: To examine the influence of acculturation, stigma tolerance, expertness, and self-efficacy on Saudi students’ intentions to seek mental health support, considering the moderating effects of COVID-19, anxiety, and depression.
•	Tools Used: SPSS (for descriptive analysis, Spearman correlation, Mann–Whitney, Kruskal–Wallis, and multiple linear regression).
•	Main Tasks: Conducted survey-based analysis on 196 participants; evaluated demographic factors; performed correlation and regression modeling to identify predictors of mental health help-seeking; and assessed the impact of COVID-19 and psychological factors.
•	Results & Impact: Found that expertness, host culture adaptation, and gender significantly predicted help-seeking intentions, while depression and anxiety negatively influenced them. The findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive mental health interventions and awareness programs for international students.
